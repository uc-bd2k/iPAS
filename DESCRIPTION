Description: This package provides functions for calculating pathway scores
    based on integrative Pathway Activity Signatures (iPAS). These signatures
    were created using the LINCS L1000 differential expression dataset. We 
    integrate data across twelve cell lines and use machine learning methods to
    find genes whose expression consistently reacts to pathway perturbation.
